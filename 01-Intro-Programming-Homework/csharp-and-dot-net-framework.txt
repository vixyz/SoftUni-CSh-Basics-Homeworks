C# is an elegant and type-safe object-oriented language that enables developers to build a variety of secure and robust applications that run on the .NET Framework.
You can use C# to create Windows client applications, XML Web services, distributed components, client-server applications, database applications, and much, much more. 
C# programs run on the .NET Framework, an integral component of Windows that includes a virtual execution system called the common language runtime (CLR) and a unified 
set of class libraries. The CLR is the commercial implementation by Microsoft of the common language infrastructure (CLI), an international standard that is the basis 
for creating execution and development environments in which languages and libraries work together seamlessly.
